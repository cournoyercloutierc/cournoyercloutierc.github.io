          <p>I am a PhD Candidate in Astrophysics at McMaster University, expected to graduate in Spring/Summer 2025. 
		  I have received a MSc from McMaster in 2021, and a BSc from McGill in 2019. 
		  I am passionate about astronomy and astrophysics, and I strongly believe that science is for everyone. 
		  I have been involved in several EDI initiatives since I started my post-secondary education, and I am a firm 
		  advocate for incorporating EDI practices in outreach and teaching. I have extensive outreach experience in astronomy, 
		  physics, and history, including current work with McMaster's W. J. McCallion planetarium and portable planetarium. 
		  As head teaching assistant for McMaster's Department of Physics & Astronomy two largest courses since 2020,

          <p>The formation of binaries within star clusters is the most common outcome of star formation, and understanding how massive binaries 
		  and their parent cluster influence one another during star cluster formation is crucial to our understanding of star formation 
		  at all redshifts. My research focuses on the interplay between binary stars and star clusters. I use numerical simulations to 
		  study how the fraction of stars in binaries, and the orbits of such binaries, change during the hierarchical formation of star 
		  clusters within giant molecular clouds. I also explore how massive binaries influence cluster formation through their effect on 
		  stellar dynamics and stellar feedback. </p>

    We implemented a new scheme for primordial binary formation in the star cluster formation code TORCH. We compared simulations with, and without, 
    primordial binaries and followed the dynamical evolution of the binary population in both sets of simulations. 
    We found that both dynamical formation and destruction of binaries take place while the cluster is actively forming new stars. 
    We found that an initial population of binaries is needed at all masses to reproduce observed binary fractions for binaries with mass ratios above the q ≥ 0.1 detection limit. 
    Dynamical interactions in the presence of gas during cluster formation modify the initial distributions towards binaries with smaller primary masses, larger mass ratios, smaller semimajor axes and larger eccentricities. 
    Systems formed dynamically do not have the same properties as the initial systems, and systems formed dynamically in the presence of an initial population of binaries differ from those formed in simulations with single stars only. The results are presented in

  <p>Cumulative distributions of primary masses, mass ratios, semi-major axes and eccentricities for binary systems formed dynamically in simulations without primordial binaries (blue) and in simulations with
  primordial binaries (yellow), compared to the primordial binaries sampled from observations (black). The distributions are different for all four parameters;
  the cumulative distributions for dynamical binaries in simulations with primordial binaries always lie between the cumulative distributions for primordial binaries 
  and for dynamically-formed binaries in simulations without primordial binaries.</p>

    We performed simulations of star cluster formation to investigate the morphological evolution of embedded star clusters in the earliest stages of their evolution. 
    Our key results are as follows: (1) Cluster mass growth is not monotonic, and clusters can lose up to half of their mass while they are embedded. 
    (2) Cluster morphology is not correlated with cluster mass and changes over ~0.01 Myr time-scales. 
    (3) The morphology of an embedded cluster is not indicative of its long-term evolution but only of its recent history: 
    radius and ellipticity increase sharply when a cluster accretes stars. 
    (4) The dynamical evolution of very young embedded clusters with masses ≲1000 M⊙ is dominated by the overall gravitational 
    potential of the star-forming region rather than by internal dynamical processes such as two- or few-body relaxation.
    The results are presented in

    Massive stars are born in clusters embedded within giant molecular clouds, 
    which they in turn influence via radiative and momentum feedback. 
    Most massive stars are also born in binaries or higher-order systems, with companions close enough to trigger mass loss 
    in excess of what is expected for single stars. Those interactions shape the feedback coming from massive stars, 
    by increasing the amount of ionizing radiation and delaying some of the first core-collapse supernovae. 
    It is therefore crucial to model concurrently those massive interacting binaries and the giant molecular cloud 
    in which they form to reach a more comprehensive understanding of cluster formation. 
    I am currently developping a new model for the implementation of feedback from massive binaries in simulations of cluster formation. 
    This model couples hydrodynamics, stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and star and binary formation, 
    and innovates by modelling the feedback from both massive single stars and massive binaries. 
    A discussion of our first results and highlighted future outlooks for this novel framework are presented in 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023tmib.confE..14C/abstract">the slides from this talk at ESO in September 2023.</a>
